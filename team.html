                    <p>Individuals who are both first-generation immigrants and first-generation college students
                        face the dual challenges of being first-generation in college and being immigrants, such as
                        limited social capital, language barriers, academic preparation, psycholo
                        gical barriers, the legal system, and cost-of-living expenses. However there is almost a lack of research and effort on this
                        intersectional minority group.</p>
                       
                        <p>
                        Research from RTI International reveals that only 24% of first-generation students earn a bachelor's degree within six years. NACADA Journal reports that compared to continuing-generation students, more first-generation students had barriers with time to use
                        resources, awareness of resources, and access to resources.</p>
                       
                        <p>
                        That's why we want to create EduLink, a one-stop educational resources hub that supports underrepresented minorities like first-generation immigrant college students. EduLink will
                        connect them to scholarships, programs, and mentorship, encourage students to participate in activities with rewards, match students with resources that will benefit them,
                        and help manage important events and deadlines.</p>

                    <p>Disasters don’t discriminate, but disaster response often does. Marginalized
                        communities—whether by race, income, or disability—face disproportionate
                        impacts, yet systemic biases hinder equitable aid distribution. Our AI-Driven
                        Bias Detector ensures fair, effective disaster relief by identifying and
                        mitigating biases in real time.</p>
                      
                        <p>
                        Using machine learning and big data, it audits aid distribution, analyzing
                        disparities in food, water, medical supplies, and shelter allocation. It flags
                        biases through real-time data from relief agencies, satellite imagery, and
                        community reports. To prevent reinforcing biases, the model undergoes
                        continuous validation with fairness-focused algorithms.</p>

                        Beyond detection, the system provides actionable recommendations for
                        equitable resource distribution and logistics optimization. A transparency
                        dashboard enables stakeholders to track response efforts, while a

                    <p>Millions of people with disabilities face challenges using and creating apps because most DIY
                        app-building platforms lack accessibility features. This leaves many individuals unable to fully
                        participate in the digital world. Our solution, the <strong>Dignity Plugin</strong>, is designed to change that by
                        seamlessly integrating accessibility tools into existing app builders.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        This plugin offers features such as screen reader support, voice navigation, high-contrast
                        display options, and customizable settings to accommodate different needs. Additionally, it
                        provides short instructional videos that guide users through tasks step by step, making app

                        By making these features easy to implement, we help DIY app builders expand their reach and
                        create a more inclusive environment. Our goal is to ensure that anyone, regardless of ability,
                        can design and use apps without barriers. With accessibility built in from the start, we can make
                        technology work for everyone.</p>

                    <p> People with disabilities are especially impacted by food insecurity, but many food
                        pantries are not made with accessibility in mind. Due to inadequately built shelving and a dearth
                        of adaptable solutions, wheelchair users frequently have difficulty reaching necessary objects.
                        Our research tackles this problem with two novel designs: the Angled Shelf System, which uses
                        a gondola-style design to make things more accessible, and the Assist Arm, an electrically
                        controlled grabber that can be put on a wheelchair and enables users to acquire objects on their
                        own. By encouraging independence and diversity, these ideas make sure that food pantries
                        better serve everyone. Our project aims to close the gap in food accessibility by creating
                        workable, scalable, and affordable solutions. Convenience is not the only goal of this project; it
                        also aims to improve equality in basic services and reconsider how public areas might serve a
                        range of needs. We hope to bring about long-lasting improvements in the accessibility of food
                        delivery through careful design.</p>

                        problem worsened by natural disasters like California wildfires. Poor air filtration 
                        disproportionately impacts underserved populations, increasing exposure to harmful pollutants 
                        and exacerbating respiratory conditions. </p>
                       
                        <p>
                        Our research focuses on developing an affordable, portable air purification system to improve 
                        indoor air quality. Equipped with HEPA and activated carbon filters, the device effectively 
                        removes wildfire smoke, dust, pollen, and bacteria. It features replaceable filters similar to 
                        household HVAC systems but in a smaller, cost-effective form. Integrated with

                        package thefts, and hit-and-runs are common. The most common deterrent for these crimes is setting up
                        security systems outside a resident’s home. However, many low-income families struggle to afford and
                        sustain these systems. To solve this issue, we plan to create and distribute low-cost security cameras made
                        from recycled materials as an alternative to commercial home security systems. The camera will function
                        alongside an app, be environmentally sustainable, and use minimal plastic to make it more
                        environmentally sustainable. We aim to make them accessible to everyone in impoverished communities.
                        Our design will include essential features of traditional security cameras, such as a light, live-view
                        camera, and a sturdy structure. Additionally, our app will allow users to connect with neighbors to share
                        information about local dangers. We hope our project helps less fortunate families feel safer in their

                        40% Nasdaq-100 ETFs, 20% customizable stocks). Free financial literacy courses and a multisignature withdrawal process encourage responsible fund use. Our sister nonprofit also accepts
                        donations to aid low-income families directly. Together, they provide a collaborative approach to
                        reducing student loan dependence and building generational wealth in underrepresented
                        communities in higher education, offering a hopeful and optimistic future.</p>

                        opportunities, financial aid, and legal resources due to work authorization 
                        restrictions, ineligibility for federal aid, and heightened fears of ICE activity.  </p>

                    <p>Natural disasters such as <strong>wildfires, floods, mudslides, and earthquakes</strong>, along with
                        human-caused crises, disproportionately affect <strong> low-income service workers</strong> in
                        California, leaving many <strong> jobless and financially vulnerable </strong> each year. The
                        <strong> AI-powered Job Recovery & Assistance Platform </strong> is a <strong> web and mobile </strong> application
                        designed to support <strong> displaced workers </strong> —including <strong> nannies, housekeepers,
                        gardeners, and other service industry workers </strong>—by providing access to
                        <strong> employment opportunities, financial aid, and legal assistance </strong>in the aftermath of
                        disasters.</p>
                      
                        <p>
                        Our proposed platform will use a multilingual <strong> AI-driven job matching, automated

                        access to critical resources</strong> for marginalized communities. A <strong> free legal aid chatbot </strong>
                        will assist workers in <strong> filing unemployment claims reporting wage theft, and basic
                        legal information</strong>. Additionally, the system will foster <strong> community-driven support

                    <p><strong>  Bridge of Hope </strong></p>
                    <p>Millions of immigrants in the U.S. face significant challenges when seeking legal assistance. Finding trustworthy, affordable and accessible legal help can be overwhelming, especially due to language barriers and a lack of clear information. Many immigrants are unaware of their rights, legal options, or available resources, leaving them vulnerable to misinformation and exploitation.</p>
                       <p>To address this issue, we propose MABITO, a mobile app designed to serve as a bridge between immigrants and essential legal resources. MABITO provides a Pro Bono Lawyer Directory, offering access to free legal assistance based on the user’s location. The app also includes real-time immigration law updates, a Know Your Rights section, and clear guides on visa processes to help users understand their legal options. To make information more accessible, MABITO supports multiple languages, ensuring that users can navigate resources in their preferred language. Additionally, the app is privacy-focused, requiring no personal data, to ensure user security and trust.</p>
                        <p>Unlike existing resources that are often limited to specific locations or languages, MABITO provides nationwide, multilingual support in a single, user-friendly platform. Our team has conducted extensive research on immigrant challenges, designed the app’s framework and is eager to develop it further.</p>
                        <p>With MABITO, no immigrant has to feel lost in the legal system. Our goal is to empower immigrants with the knowledge and resources they need to navigate their legal journey safely and confidently.</p>

                    <p>EduCARE is an educational platform designed to bridge the accessibility gap between abled and
                        disabled students. The platform integrates AI accessibility tools tailored to students’ needs,
                        particularly for students with ADHD and deafness. The proposed system will enable instructors
                        to upload course materials, and automatically format them for accessibility. Our primary focus is
                        on students with ADHD, by implementing lecture summaries and assignment deadline planning,
                        and deaf students, by adding a speech-to-text feature for video lectures.</p>
                        <p>The platform also enables students with similar peers to connect, fostering a community that
                            encourages them to share experiences and collaborate. Community features include direct
                            messaging, group forums, and profiles with contact details. Additionally, the platform makes it
                            easier for students to contact their instructors and peers for support. Through EduCARE, we aim
                            to streamline resources for disabled students and educators, as well as create a supportive
                            environment that encourages academic success.</p>

                    <p>Public transit accessibility remains a major challenge for over 1 billion people, including seniors, disabled individuals, and those in underserved regions. Existing transit solutions, such as Google Maps and Wheelmap, have struggled with real-time reliability, limited accessibility filters, and inadequate multilingual support. Many past attempts yielded mixed results due to outdated data and poor integration with transit authorities. TransitEase Shuttle is an AI-powered, on-demand shuttle service that offers dynamic route planning, wheelchair-friendly navigation, real-time incident reporting, and multilingual accessibility. Unlike conventional transit apps, it leverages IoT sensors, AI-driven optimization, and verified crowdsourced reports to ensure reliable, inclusive transportation. A gamified rewards system promotes sustainable travel, while offline functionality ensures no user is left behind. Early pilots indicate a 30% reduction in trip abandonment, proving that scalable, equitable transit is achievable. By addressing past shortcomings, TransitEase Shuttle redefines public transportation as a truly accessible and user-centric experience.</p>
