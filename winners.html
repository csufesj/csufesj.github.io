                    <p>Low-income communities often face respiratory health risks due to inadequate HVAC systems, a problem worsened by natural disasters like California wildfires. Poor air filtration disproportionately impacts underserved populations, increasing exposure to harmful pollutants and exacerbating respiratory conditions.</p>
                    <p>Our research focuses on developing an affordable, portable air purification system to improve indoor air quality. Equipped with HEPA and activated carbon filters, the device effectively removes wildfire smoke, dust, pollen, and bacteria. It features replaceable filters similar to household HVAC systems but in a smaller, cost-effective form. Integrated with sensors—including smoke, CO2, and air quality monitors like the RRH62000—the system ensures real-time monitoring.</p>
                    <p>This device enhances air quality and promotes environmental justice, by addressing filtration gaps in low-income housing, our solution supports health equity and mitigates the disproportionate effects of poor air quality on marginalized communities.</p>

                    <p>Our group chose to address home security in low-income neighborhoods, where break-ins, package thefts, and hit-and-runs are common. The most common deterrent for these crimes is setting up security systems outside a resident’s home. However, many low-income families struggle to afford and sustain these systems. To solve this issue, we plan to create and distribute low-cost security cameras made from recycled materials as an alternative to commercial home security systems. The camera will function alongside an app, be environmentally sustainable, and use minimal plastic to make it more environmentally sustainable. We aim to make them accessible to everyone in impoverished communities. Our design will include essential features of traditional security cameras, such as a light, live-view camera, and a sturdy structure. Additionally, our app will allow users to connect with neighbors to share information about local dangers. We hope our project helps less fortunate families feel safer in their homes.</p>

                    <p>Millions of people with disabilities face challenges using and creating apps because most DIY app-building platforms lack accessibility features. This leaves many individuals unable to fully participate in the digital world. Our solution, the Dignity Plugin, is designed to change that by seamlessly integrating accessibility tools into existing app builders.</p>
                    <p>This plugin offers features such as screen reader support, voice navigation, high-contrast display options, and customizable settings to accommodate different needs. Additionally, it provides short instructional videos that guide users through tasks step by step, making app creation more accessible for everyone.</p>
                    <p>By making these features easy to implement, we help DIY app builders expand their reach and create a more inclusive environment. Our goal is to ensure that anyone, regardless of ability, can design and use apps without barriers. With accessibility built in from the start, we can make technology work for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Disasters don’t discriminate, but disaster response often does. Marginalized communities—whether by race, income, or disability—face disproportionate impacts, yet systemic biases hinder equitable aid distribution. Our AI-Driven Bias Detector ensures fair, effective disaster relief by identifying and mitigating biases in real time.</p>
                    <p>Using machine learning and big data, it audits aid distribution, analyzing disparities in food, water, medical supplies, and shelter allocation. It flags biases through real-time data from relief agencies, satellite imagery, and community reports. To prevent reinforcing biases, the model undergoes continuous validation with fairness-focused algorithms.</p>
                    <p>Beyond detection, the system provides actionable recommendations for equitable resource distribution and logistics optimization. A transparency dashboard enables stakeholders to track response efforts, while a crowdfunding feature empowers communities to mobilize aid. In an era of escalating crisis, our AI-powered solution enhances transparency, accountability, and resilience, ensuring every resource reaches those in need.</p>

                    <p>Transgender individuals are subject to unique health disparities which afflict both physiological and psychological harm. As the visibility of the transgender community has increased in the public consciousness, so too has the demand increased for gender-affirming healthcare products and services. Despite this need, transgender individuals continue to report a lack of accessible transgender medical resources. TranscendCare directly addresses the issue of transgender accessibility to healthcare services by enabling questioning and selfidentifying transgender individuals to directly take control of their gender-affirming healthcare experience. This is achieved through the utilization of an integrated PDA device, myEgg, which centralizes transgender medical resources and patient information such as affirming-care provider directories and patient treatment plans. Informed by the real-world experiences of stakeholders in the transgender community, myEgg also serves as a personal companion tool for transgender individuals to connect with their local gender non-conforming community in a safe, moderated environment. The combination of tangible healthcare resources with a community-based approach to individual wellness defines myEgg as a novel solution to transgender healthcare diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

                    <p>More than 86.3 million Americans are disabled (CDC 2022). Even with the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, approximately 30% of American businesses and public spaces remain non-accommodating to those with disabilities (IAMV 2020). Additionally, our research survey of 11 local disabled folks indicated in their interviews that they all experienced difficulty navigating public spaces independently. OpenDoors aims to create a nationwide disabled-led review site for ADA compliance of local businesses. By crowdsourcing reviews from disabled individuals, we will create a thorough ADA access guide for the disabled. OpenDoors also accommodates both visible and invisible disabilities with its reviews. OpenDoors' reviews will also ensure businesses are held accountable for being accessible for our entire disabled community, as is mandated by law. OpenDoors aims to empower disabled voices, encourage public spaces and businesses to improve accessibility, and foster a more inclusive society.</p>
