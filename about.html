            <div class="about_title"><h2>Competition History</h2></div>
            <div class="about_description">The Engineering Social Justice (ESJ) Competition at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) was established in 2022 as an annual event that encourages students to develop innovative solutions addressing social justice issues.
                <br /><br />The ESJ Competition is funded by the Scott-Jewett Fund for Student Success and Innovation which provide one-time funding for proposals that focus on student success and innovation through the lens of social justice. It is also sponsored by Southern California Edison.

            <div class="about_title"><h2>Objective</h2></div>
<div class="about_description">The primary objective of the CSUF Engineering Social Justice (ESJ) Competition is to empower students to apply engineering and computer science skills to address real-world social justice challenges. By encouraging innovative thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community engagement, the competition seeks to cultivate a generation of socially conscious engineers and computer scientists who can design solutions that promote equity, inclusion, and sustainability. Students are challenged to critically examine systemic issues and develop technology-driven proposals that can create meaningful social impact.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="about_section">
            <div class="about_title"><h2>Process</h2></div>
<div class="about_description">The CSUF ESJ Competition process begins with students forming interdisciplinary teams of 4 to 6 members from any department within the College of Engineering and Computer Science. The competition strongly encourages participation from students at all academic levels, especially first and second year students. Each team collaborates closely with a faculty mentor and our social equity mentors. To support their project development, students attend a series of workshops focused on key topics like design thinking, social impact, and effective communication.
    <br /><br />As the competition progresses, teams present their ideas to a panel for the chance to win monetary awards—$6,000 for first place, $4,000 for second, and $2,000 for third. Additionally, exceptional projects may receive further financial support from the Dean’s Office, encouraging continued innovation and community impact beyond the competition itself.

            <div class="about_title"><h2>Student support</h2></div>
   <div class="about_description">The CSUF ESJ Competition offers extensive student support to ensure participants are well-equipped to turn their ideas into impactful solutions. Each team is paired with a faculty mentor who provides guidance throughout the project lifecycle, from initial ideation to final presentation. They are also encouraged to consult our social equity mentors to get further insights about their work.
    <br /><br /> To further support student development, the competition includes a series of skill-building workshops that cover technical topics, design thinking, and community engagement strategies. In addition to mentorship and training, students have access to financial resources such as prize money to continue working on their ideas after the competition. This multi-layered support system helps foster confidence, creativity, and a sense of purpose among participants, reinforcing the competition’s mission of empowering students to be agents of change.
